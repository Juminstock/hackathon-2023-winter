Vinestar is an experience where wine enthusiasts and producers connect on the web3 in order to buil loyalty and promote their economic relationship.

Through smart contracts, we will be able to establish a secondary market for wine consumers experience. In an industry where large vineyards comprise the bulk of trade, this project seeks to generate commercial links between small and medium sized producers and customers, and through the acquisition of NFTs, as a financing product, the producer can innovate in his vineyard and the user can acquire an investment product that can be translated into green purchasing percentages for wines whose score by wine criticts is high, which gives the investor a potential return on his NFT.
